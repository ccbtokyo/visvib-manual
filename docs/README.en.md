## Overview

This project, **VisVib**, is a system that uses an instrument called tone chimes to experience sound as light and video.
It was developed during the process of creating music workshops that can be enjoyed by deaf and hard-of-hearing
individuals, in collaboration
with [Civic Creative Base Tokyo [CCBT]](https://ccbt.rekibun.or.jp/), [Tokyo University of the Arts Art Media Center (AMC)](https://amc.geidai.ac.jp),
and [Tokyo Bunka Kaikan](https://www.t-bunka.jp/).

To share the results of this project more widely, we have made the **VisVib** system open-source.

The development process of the device and workshop is published
in [CCBT's Research Notes](https://ccbt.rekibun.or.jp/research-notes/diverstiy-and-inclusion-project-02).
